### Kaitlyn
During the semester, Kaitlyn contributed by working with and “specializing” in learning the Google Maps API. She worked on maps with different functionalities. For example, she created a multiple marker map with clickable info windows that displayed information and another that returned the place ID based on an address typed in to the search bar. She worked alongside Timmy to implement POST commands from backend database using the REST API to get place data for markers. Finally, she also worked on the UI/UX of the website through pilot testing of the website and wireframing.
